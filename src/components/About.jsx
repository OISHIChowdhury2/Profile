         I worked as a Trainee Software Engineer in Era Infotech.I am expertise in full-stack JavaScript
            development with experience using Node.js and Next.js. That's a valuable skill set in today's technology industry,
            as JavaScript continues to be one of the most popular programming languages for both front-end and back-end web development.
            As a full-stack developer, I have the ability to work on both the server-side and client-side of web applications, which makes me a valuable asset to any team. Node.js is a popular runtime environment that allows you to use JavaScript on the server side, while Next.js is a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications.
            Overall, my skills and experience in full-stack JavaScript development make me a valuable and versatile member of the tech community.
